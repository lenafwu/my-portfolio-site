      <h2>3D Model of Game Character - class project</h2>
      <p>
        This final project is mainly an attempt to apply the various Blender
        technics learnt to build cartoon-style 3D models, with reference of real
        world figures and hand-drew sketches, as natural, detailed and
        good-looking as possible. Several animations were designed for the
        humanoid characters. Simple environment objects are also added as
        required. Unity project was created with basic set up of movement as a
        showcase stage for the models. The final result is interesting and
        promising and countless valuable experiences are gained during this
        journey ðŸ˜Š

      <h2>Delivery Tracker</h2>
      <p>
        This is a web application to track the time, income, expenses for a food
        delivery driver. It is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and hosted
        on Replit. It is a practice project for me to learn and mainly focused
        on the back-end. Project is kept private as no authentication is set up
        yet. I'm planning to write front-end using React.js in the future.
